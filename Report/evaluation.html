    <h1 style="color:white;">Evaluation</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">For meeting the brief, I made a video to show how my website meet the advanced and basic
        requirements. I also explained my code and website. Then for investigation stage, I searched for my dataset in
        many platforms and choose the best one. I researched solutions to how to make my website better. For plan and
        design, I made a flowchart and architecture diagram to show how my website works. I also did wireframes for an
        example of my website and showed my code and failed code. In create section, I showed my weekly progress by
        putting a picture and explaining each week. I also did testing table for my survey again showing the progress of
        my code.</p>
    <p style="color:white;">If I had more time with this project, I would like to add more features to my graphs. I
        would add a dropdown button where you can choose the type of the bar (for example: bar, line , pie, polar and
        etc) and I would also like to make it able to change colour of the graphs by choosing the colours. With those
        two it would be better for user intractability and understanding. </p>

    <p style="color:white;">I would give a more professional look on the website and put more information for the user
        to gain a deeper understanding of earthquakes, such as facts about earthquakes and display images. It would
        increase the user intractability and depth of knowledge</p>
