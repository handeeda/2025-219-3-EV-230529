    <p style="color:white;">In week 1, I started by reading the raw data and checking the all columns have the correct title. During this
        project the hardest part was cleaning the data. First problem that I was faced with was country names were
        containing invalid text (ex. /, @, !, $, etc.). I wrote a variable with a name of placeholder and then replace
        the invalid characters by valid characters. It took me a long time to figure out what to do. The second problem
        I was faced with was cleaning the years. There was unnecessary information and I needed only a specific one.
        Again I wrote a variable with the name of placeholder and select that column. Then I selected the information
        that I didn’t need and delete them. I stored the clean data in ”clean_data” file. So I finished week 2 like
        that. </p>
    <br>

    <p style="color:white;">In week 3, I needed to send the clean data to firebase and store the information in there. Then I checked if the
        information that has been sent was correct or not.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Week 4, was about calculations. In this week I calculated the average magnitude in a new file called
        “analyse_graph_data”. By writing a function and a for loop, it was easier to identify the code. Then I printed
        the country and the info to see if it was the correct information. </p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">In week 5, I did the same thing with average depth and then printed the country and info to see if it was
        correct. I printed a specific country so it is easier to calculate the correct average. Then I did
        recommendations on the same file so I can get the information from firebase and easily use it in my JavaScript
        code. First I did experienced earthquakes and it went well. But in the second one which is strongest earthquake,
        I couldn’t do it on the same file because it needed the original file. So I needed to do it on the same file as
        my cleaning code goes. I tried in there and it worked well. Then I send the information to firebase.</p>

    <br>

    <p style="color:white;">In week 6, because I send the information to firebase I was able to easily take the information and do the same
        graphs on JavaScript. </p>

    <br>

    <p style="color:white;">In week 7, I did a choosing box where user can select the countries and then the graph responds to it and changes
        the graph for that country. For this I needed to write a function in JavaScript called “populate_countries” so
        that there will be a dropdown menu where they can select the country. I got the countries names from firebase
        and carry it to the code that I have written.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">In week 8, after I checked the information that has been sent to firebase is correct, I started on my survey. I
        write all the needed information into the survey including users first and last name so that when it is sent to
        firebase it will have a specific ID. That’s why in week 9, I made a submit button so that the information that
        they have entered can be sent to firebase. I also needed to display an information for user rom the data that
        they have entered, so I decided to make a graph about how many people have experienced earthquake. It is a graph
        that show how many people have said yes or no to the question. Then I put the average people that have
        experienced earthquake at the bottom with a text</p>

    <img src="test_table_lname.PNG" alt="test_table_lname" width="500" height="300">

    <p style="color:white;">In week 10, I started on my recommendations. In here I used “populate_countries” again to make a dropdown list
        that contains all the countries. Then I changed the sample answer to the information that I want to display for
        that country. I did the same for my second recommendation but created a function called “populate_years”. It had
        the same idea but rather than countries, I created a dropdown list contains each year. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">In week 11, it was time to style the webpage. I made the background black and made graphs colourful so that it
        will pop up on the background better. I made a navigation bar to switch between survey and the main page so it
        will look better. In my survey I made my graph colourful too so the user can understand and see the graph
        better.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">In week 12, I started on my report and designed it so it will look better. After I finished the video too my
        project was successfully finished and was ready.</p>
