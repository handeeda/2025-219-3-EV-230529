    <h1 style="color:white;">Investigation</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">The first think I thought about my website is about doing movies or video games is because I have an interest in
        them and thought it will attract the audience while they are using my website. I looked at
        https://www.kaggle.com for both topics (games and movies). Kaggle offered me good help with choosing my topic.
        First I was planning to do earthquakes in my country which is Turkiye, than I thought about the other people in
        this world and decided to do my website for all the people and not just people in Turkiye. I also looked at
        https://disneyanimation.com for Disney movies, but I couldn't find the dataset I want. Then I looked at
        https://huggingface.com for video games dataset. I have found the best dataset for it in this site, but then I
        decided to do a website that gives information about problems in the world.</p>

    <p style="color:white;">Movies can remind us of our childhood while the only thing we were believing unicorns and eating candy. Although
        when we grow up we start to get away from the dream world and starting to face the real world. That's why I was
        thinking to do Disney movies which would help the audience to return to those times so the website will appeal
        to the users more. But I gave up on this idea because I wanted to focus on the reality of the world which we
        live in rather than a dream that we created on our mind. We cant wait for someone to save us like in the movies,
        we have to learn the facts abouts the world and get ourselves ready for it.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">That's why I choosed the topic of earthquakes. I choose this topic because, I think this topic is very relevant
        in today's world. Natural events (flood, earthquake, volcanoes, forest fires, etc.) have always endangered
        people and earthquakes is one of the most significant natural events in my opinion.</p>
