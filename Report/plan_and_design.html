    <p style="color:white;">In my website I wanted to give the user a platform where they can easily learn information. For this first I
        needed to find a dataset that interests me and user. That's how I came up with the idea of the earthquakes in
        the world. I started to do my project with python and pandas. I cleaned the dataset with pandas by dropping
        unnecessary columns, removing invalid characters from country names and deleting the unnecessary information
        (ex. 1990-01-01 00:22:33.990000+00:00 ïƒ  1999). Then send it to Firebase so it will be stored in there. After I
        cleaned the dataset, I created a new excel file called 'clean_data_year_test.csv'.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">I got information from clean csv file and did graphs for average magnitude and average depth. By creating a
        dictionary called `average magnitude`, I calculated it in a function and for loop. Just to make sure I printed
        one country in Thonny. After I did the same thing with `average depth`, I started on recommendations that will
        be on my website.</p>

    <br>

    <p style="color:white;">The first one was experienced_earthquakes. For that I did a function and wrote a for loop so
        it will count the experienced earthquakes in each country. The second one was strongest_earthquake. There is two
        code for this. The first code which didn't worked was in `analysed graph data`. I tried to get the strongest
        earthquake magnitude and country in that year. Although it didn't worked. Then I did it on my cleaning file so
        the magnitudes will reset. The second one worked better so I send both recommendations to firebase. I also sent
        average magnitude and average depth calculations on firebase too. </p>

    <p style="color:white;">After I did my graphs in python I skipped to JavaScript. I did my graphs on JavaScript too and started to design
        my website with JS, HTML and CSS on Visual Studio Code. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">For my website, I did a navigation bar where users can switch between survey and the main page. I wanted to make
        it a dark background since it is a dark topic in my opinion. Although I made the graph bars colourful, so it
        will appear better on the background. At the bottom I put my recommendations</p>

    <p style="color:white;">In my survey, after I made a form I did a colourful graph where it displays the information about user and gives
        them feedback. With that I made my website more functional and better for user.</p>
