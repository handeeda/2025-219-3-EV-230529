    <p style="color:white;">I decided to analyse earthquake data, my information system will allow people to look at the
        history of earthquakes in countries over the period 1990-2023. I selected it because it is a topic I have
        interest in and happens in my country frequently.
        The target audience is people from the age of 18 or older who may wish to research about earthquakes.
        I am going to approach this using the Agile software methodology. As it is more suited for my project and will
        allow me to do a little bit testing while coding and writing.
        I believe my interactive information system meets both basic and advanced requirements.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p style="color:white;">I will use the following technologies:</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Basic requirement 1: I used Thonny by using the python language and pandas to clean and drop
        the unnecessary columns. To store it I used Firebase.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Basic requirement 2: Again I used python and matplotlib to draw the graphs in Thonny. Then I
        used dictionaries to manage the data that I analysed.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Basic requirement 3: by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS in visual studio code I created an
        interactive information system by displaying it in the graphs.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Advanced requirement 1: users can interact with graphs by choosing the country they want to
        see. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Advanced requirement 2: There is a form for users to fill in and they can display
        information that has been collected and stored from users. The form has at least three different data types and
        the collected data from users are displayed on a graph. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">Advanced requirement 3: At the end of the main page there is recommendations where users can
        interact and select years and country that they want to display information about. It helps to inform decisions
        based on the analysis of the dataset.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">I have used python to clean and store the data in firebase and to draw graphs. Then I used
        JavaScript to get information from firebase to draw interactive graphs, put recommendations for more user
        interactivity and made a survey to display information about user to give them feedback.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:white;">My social concern with regard to my information system is that it may discourage people from
        visiting certain countries due to the frequency of earthquakes and this may cause them to miss out on enriching
        cultural experiences. In my survey I am purposely not showing user names, all results will be anonymus.</p>
